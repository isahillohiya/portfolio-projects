### 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
<br/>

#### Approach
- Merge ```Menu``` and ```sales``` tables to access **product_id** and **price** at same time 
- group by **customer_id** and use SUM() with **price** to get total money spend by each customer


```` sql
select customer_id , sum(price) "Total spent"
from 
	menu m 
        inner join 
    sales s 
		on 
    s.product_id = m.product_id 
group by s.customer_id ;
````


#### Output:
| customer_id | Total spent |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |

#### Insight 
- Customer A spent total $76 
- Customer b spent total $74
- Customer c spent total $36


</br>


### 2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?

#### Approach 
- group by **customer_id** in table ```sales``` and count unique visits of each customer through **Order_date** column 
  
  

````sql
select customer_id  , count(distinct order_date) "Unique visit #" 
from sales
group by customer_id; 
````

  
#### Output:
| customer_id | Unique visit #  |
| ----------- | ----------- 	|
| A           | 4          		|
| B           | 6          		|
| C           | 2          		|

#### Insights 
- Customer A visited 4 times.
- Customer B visited 6 times.
- Customer C visited 2 times.

</br>


### 3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
</br>

#### Approach
- create new column named **Purchase_rank** that ranks **customer_id** based on **order_date** 
- select data where **Purchase_rank** is 1 to get first item purchased by each customer
  
  </br>

````sql
with temp_table
as (
select s.customer_id  , m.product_id , m.product_name , DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date) Purchase_rank
from sales s
		inner join 
	menu m
		on
	s.product_id = m.product_id
 ) select customer_id, product_name  from temp_table where Purchase_rank = 1 ;
````
</br>
 
#### Output :
| customer_id | product_name | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | curry        | 
| A           | sushi        |

</br> 

### 4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
</br>

#### Approach 

- Join ```menu``` and ```sales``` via **product_id** to access  **product_id** and **product_name** in same table 
- group by **product_id** and count **product_id** to get number of each product is bought. 
- order them in desending order and limit rows to 1 to get the product that is boutght maximumn times.
 
 </br>


````sql
select m.product_name, count(s.product_id) "# purchased"
from sales s
	inner join
    menu m 
    on 
    s.product_id = m.product_id
group by s.product_id
order by count(product_id) desc limit 1 ;

````

</br>

  
#### Output 
| product_name   | # purchased  |

</br>

#### Approach

- select data where **product_rank** is 1 to get most popular item ordered by each customer


</br>

```` sql
select customer_id,product_name
from  (select s.customer_id ,m.product_name, DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY COUNT(s.customer_id) DESC) product_rank
	   from sales s
				inner join 
			menu m
				on 
			s.product_id = m.product_id
		group by s.customer_id,m.product_name
            ) as tbl 
where product_rank = 1 ;
````

-  create new column named **given_rank** that ranks **customer_id** based on **order_date** 
-  To get first order of each customer, select data that have **given_rank** equal to 1  


</br>

````sql
with itm_purchased_cte
as(
select s.customer_id ,product_name, dense_rank() over (partition by customer_id order by order_date) given_rank
from 
	sales s 
		inner join 
    members me
		on 
	s.customer_id = me.customer_id 
		inner join 
	menu m 
		on 
    s.product_id = m.product_id
