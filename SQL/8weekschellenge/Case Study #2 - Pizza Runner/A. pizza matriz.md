from customer_orders ;

````

- Total of 14 pizzas were ordered.

### 2. How many unique customer orders were made?

````sql
select count(distinct customer_id) as 'Unique customers'
from customer_orders ;
````

**Output:**

from runner_orders_temp 
where cancellation is NULL 
group by runner_id;
````

**Output:**

- Runner 1 has 4 successful delivered orders.
- Runner 2 has 3 successful delivered orders.
- Runner 3 has 1 successful delivered order.

### 4. How many of each type of pizza was delivered?

````sql
select sum(
		case 
        when pizza_id = 1 then 1
        end
	) as 'Type 1'
,  sum(
		case 
        when pizza_id = 2 then 1
        end
	)  'Type 2' 
from customer_orders_temp  
where order_id in (
					select order_id 
                    from runner_orders_temp 
                    where cancellation is null
                    ) ; -- returns order_id which are not cancelled 
````

from customer_orders_temp
where order_id in (
					select order_id 
                    from runner_orders_temp 
                    where cancellation is null
                    )  -- returns order_id which are not cancelled 
order by Max_Number_of_pizza desc

### 7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?

  SUM(
    CASE WHEN c.exclusions <> ' ' OR c.extras <> ' ' THEN 1
    ELSE 0
    END) AS at_least_1_change,
  SUM(
    CASE WHEN c.exclusions = ' ' AND c.extras = ' ' THEN 1 
    ELSE 0
    END) AS no_change
FROM customer_orders_temp c
JOIN runner_orders_temp r
  ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE r.distance != 0
GROUP BY c.customer_id
ORDER BY c.customer_id;
````

**Output:**


- Customer 101 and 102 does not want any changes for their pizza
- Customer 103, 104 and 105 prefer  to make changes in their pizza

### 8. How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?

````sql

where  order_id in (
			select order_id
